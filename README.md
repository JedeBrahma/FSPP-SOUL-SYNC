Soul Sync is a daily morning ritual app to help a user feel spiritually in sync with the universe and get off to having a fabulous day! A random inspiring quote, an oracle card ( also random )generated by the energy of the user, check into how they are feeling - with a note field if they choose, the color of the day and space to express gratitude. My intention is to allow the user to feel in synchronicity with the Universe within just a few minutes by using this application. A quick virtual journal that allows for centering and grounding using randomness within the quantum synchonized chaos of our life. 
Users will be able to reflect on a weekly or monthly basis to see how they are feeling and to add/edit their journal.
